    "# Yelp Sentiment Analysis with BERT\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Yelp Sentiment Analysis with BERT project, I undertook the task of sentiment analysis on Yelp reviews using state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques. The goal of the project was to analyze the sentiment of user reviews for various desert businesses on Yelp, providing valuable insights into customer opinions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Web Scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Utilized web scraping techniques to extract reviews from Yelp pages of different desert businesses.\n",
    "- Employed the BeautifulSoup library to parse HTML content and retrieve relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Sentiment Analysis with BERT:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implemented sentiment analysis using BERT, a powerful transformer-based model for natural language processing.\n",
    "- Utilized the Hugging Face Transformers library to access a pre-trained BERT model for sequence classification.\n",
    "- Tokenized the reviews, passed them through the BERT model, and extracted sentiment scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Storage and Manipulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Employed the pandas library to store and manipulate data in a structured format.\n",
    "- Created a DataFrame to store reviews and their corresponding sentiment scores.\n",
    "- Iterated over multiple Yelp URLs, collected reviews, and appended them to the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technologies Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python\n",
    "- BeautifulSoup\n",
    "- Hugging Face Transformers\n",
    "- Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "This Yelp Sentiment Analysis project not only showcases technical skills in web scraping and natural language processing but also highlights the ability to extract meaningful insights from unstructured data. The sentiment scores can be leveraged by businesses to understand customer sentiments and improve overall customer satisfaction."
